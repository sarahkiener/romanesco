Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted . 
“ From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine -- ” 
For their own comfort they would much rather have remained , at least all the morning , in Mrs. Jennings 's house ; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody . 
“ Woodston will make but a sombre appearance today . ” 
Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them . 
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . 
What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! ” 
“ My sweetest Catherine , is not this delightful ? 
That Louisa must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt . 
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself . 
I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer . 
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self-control ; but it wants openness . 
He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance . 
“ Yes , that 's the book ; such unnatural stuff ! 
They will soon be back again , and then they 'd be sure and call here . '' 
Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society ; and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him , speaking certainly without the prejudice , the blindness of love , she ought to be believed . 
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters . 
`` But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ? '' 
I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . 
It is not a mere bit of gossip . 
And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ? 
While Sir William was with them , Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing , and looking out of the window in his own book-room , which fronted the road . 
She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment 's pause , added : 
“ And how are you to be conveyed back again ? 
You will take in the whole of the past , you will consider times , persons , and probabilities , and you will feel that _they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot . 
“ I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself -- for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . ” 
Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . 
But neither the business alleged , nor the magnificent compliment , could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose . 
In a few minutes the servant returned , and with a look which did not quite confirm his words , said he had been mistaken , for that Miss Tilney was walked out . 
Two days after Mr. Bennet 's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , “ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ” 
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst . 
The possibility of the young man 's coming to Mrs. Goddard 's that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . 
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman 's family . 
Mr. Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton . 
His immediate communications were exhausted , and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him , now at one , now at another of the beloved circle ; but the pause was not long : in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative , and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say , “ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir Thomas ? 
In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane , 
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch . 
“ I certainly will come . 
how tired you must both be ! 
I can not think of it. -- It wo n't do. -- Then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . 
Born to the prospect of such affluence ! 
Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 
It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire . 
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham -- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself -- her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . 
She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held . 
It would probably be the middle of November at least ; the middle of November was three months off . 
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . ” 
She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother 's unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . 
The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . 
“ May I , indeed ? -- Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . 
shocking ! ” cried Miss Bingley . 
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity -- to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment . 
Collins , you must send a servant with them . 
“ Very true , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two -- there can be no difference . 
Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John . 
“ And that prevented you , ” said Henry , earnestly regarding her . 
Can not you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel ? 
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . 
She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on . 
“ Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . ” 
Did she call to refuse her consent ? ” 
I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . 
Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . 
Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue . 
Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions . 
He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word `` infection '' to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby 's account . 
That General Tilney , instead of disliking , should admire her , was very delightful ; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom she need now fear to meet . 
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . ” 
He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at Lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person 's manners . 
Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say -- 
“ But what is all this whispering about ? 
It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little Harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ? 
`` Oh ! 
“ It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . 
Emma was silenced . 
Mrs. Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma 's uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , 
“ Brother and sister ! 
I can not approve of it . 
“ How is it possible ? ” cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs. Goddard 's in his way . 
“ Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of . ” 
“ But so we all do . 
The neighbourhood was not large , but the Musgroves were visited by everybody , and had more dinner-parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance , than any other family . 
At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully . 
I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . 
But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well-bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark . 
They were natural and just . 
“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ” 
He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own . 
“ When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . 
You shall be Cottager 's wife . ” 
When her two dances with him were over , her inclination and strength for more were pretty well at an end ; and Sir Thomas , having seen her walk rather than dance down the shortening set , breathless , and with her hand at her side , gave his orders for her sitting down entirely . 
But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . 
I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery . 
He is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw , and amazingly disagreeable . 
“ Certainly , if you wish it ; -- but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ? ” 
You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . 
Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth 's name must be mentioned by both . 
It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference . 
Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . 
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . 
“ Oh ! 
“ Cut down an avenue ! 
“ What is the matter ? ” said she . 
They have no mercy on her . ” 
By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody 's striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character . 
I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . 
Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . 
She found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself . 
So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! 
“ There goes good-humour , I am sure , ” said he presently . 
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . 
“ You are too hasty , sir , ” she cried . 
“ Well , ” continued Edmund , “ and how did you like what you saw ? ” 
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change . 
“ I told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . 
So there I have the whip hand of you . '' 
CHAPTER IV 
The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith . 
I must make him know that I will not be tricked on the south side of Everingham , any more than on the north : that I will be master of my own property . 
It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . 
“ My horse ! 
not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm . 
“ Not at all . ” 
The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon -- or such a companion for her mother , -- how gratefully was it felt ! -- a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her ! -- as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it . 
But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs. Jennings 's suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two ; -- she watched his eyes , while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour ; -- and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne 's feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady 's observation ; -- SHE could discover in them the quick feelings , and needless alarm of a lover . 
“ By all means , ” cried Bingley ; “ let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . 
Harriet looked white and frightened , and he was trying to cheer her. -- The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder ; -- they were all three soon in the hall , and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away . 
but those two lines are ” -- 
I know we shall be happy . 
Marianne pressed her hand and replied , 
The three others still continued together , walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine ; sometimes not a word was said , sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches , and her arm was still linked within Isabella 's , though their hearts were at war . 
how little a clear manner , and good delivery , have been attended to ! 
`` Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed ? -- But I can not talk . '' 
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield . 
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady 's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others . 
“ And I am convinced to the contrary . 
Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere . 
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . 
I admire all that quaint , old-fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . 
If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 
Oh ! 
Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . 
how he 'll chuckle over this news ! 
If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week -- that acting week . 
Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior. -- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her. -- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else. -- There he was , among the standers-by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing , -- not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist-players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up , -- so young as he looked ! -- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . 
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce . 
She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . 
They were indebted , the next day , to Charles Hayter , for all the minute knowledge of Louisa , which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours . 
Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him . 
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . 
And when you have given _your_ ball , ” she added , “ I shall insist on their giving one also . 
A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne 's side produced nearly a cure on Mary 's . 
I believe him to be Lady Catherine 's _nephew_ . 
If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . 
“ Is that his design in settling here ? ” 
She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! 
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . 
He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton 's conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs. Elton 's looks also received the due share of censure . 
“ You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! 
I do not care for myself . 
The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out , -- 
The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds , is another thing . 
A sick child is always the mother 's property : her own feelings generally make it so . '' 
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr. Darcy 's civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . 
It was a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she had feared . 
But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father 's happiness -- in other words , his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise . 
Children of the same family , the same blood , with the same first associations and habits , have some means of enjoyment in their power , which no subsequent connexions can supply ; and it must be by a long and unnatural estrangement , by a divorce which no subsequent connexion can justify , if such precious remains of the earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived . 
Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . '' 
The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more . 
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . ” 
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . 
“ I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . ” 
Come , and tell me . 
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . 
“ I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are -- ” 
She had none of Fanny 's delicacy of taste , of mind , of feeling ; she saw Nature , inanimate Nature , with little observation ; her attention was all for men and women , her talents for the light and lively . 
Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . 
“ What is it my dear friend ? 
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . 
Whatever he might have heard against me -- ought he not to have suspended his belief ? 
On his return to the breakfast-room , he found Mrs. Norris trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford 's being of the party were desirable or not , or whether her brother 's barouche would not be full without her . 
Have all her friends left her ? ” 
Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her . 
Cole has servants to send . 
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable . 
“ No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ? 
“ Yes , it is exactly behind the house ; begins at a little distance , and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds . 
Only let me be told when I may speak out. -- I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . ” 
my dear Miss Dashwood ! 
It is the general way all young men do . ” 
Every body must have seen the snow coming on . 
She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted . 
But , as it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on Margaret 's instructions , extended . 
I know no one more entitled , by unpretending merit , or better prepared by habitual suffering , to receive and enjoy felicity . 
Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? 
Emma was sorry ; -- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months ! -- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! 
Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist , and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin 's care , but with great regret that she was not stronger . 
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 
Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . 
“ You had better explore to Donwell , ” replied Mr. Knightley . 
The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated , and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern , that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford 's , the truth , or at least the strength of her indifference , might well be questionable ; and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him , in the professions of persevering , assiduous , and not desponding attachment which closed the interview . 
`` I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . 
The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives . 
His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . 
Her own thoughts were employing her . 
“ Nonsense ! 
You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . 
He thought of his own four children , of his two sons , of cousins in love , etc . 
This charade ! -- If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it . ” 
“ Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but _that_ would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . 
Should not the Colonel write himself ? -- sure , he is the proper person . '' 
I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . ” 
Did you think I ought ? ” 
The morrow came , the plan for the evening continued , and Fanny 's consideration of it did not become less agitated . 
He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages , -- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her . 
`` Oh ! 
I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . 
“ I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . ” 
She had begun to think he really loved her , and to fancy his affection for her something more than common ; and his sister still said that he cared for nobody else . 
These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much . 
The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming -- 
“ Miss Bingley told me , ” said Jane , “ that he never speaks much , unless among his intimate acquaintances . 
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell . 
Your brother 's taste and your sisters ' seem very different . ” 
Ah ! 
He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked . 
“ Shall you indeed ! ” said Catherine very seriously . 
Elizabeth , though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it . 
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend . 
There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good-humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied . 
To Caroline 's assertion of her brother 's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit . 
“ He is also handsome , ” replied Elizabeth , “ which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . 
Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances. -- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . 
So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma'am , do not let us think about it any more . ” 
He saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect . 
“ A mother would have been always present . 
To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . '' 
She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted Anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . 
“ Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . 
Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . 
But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself . 
But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby 's pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind . 
`` But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . 
`` Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you ? -- Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . 
She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . 
Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also ; but this was scarcely received as an amendment : the young ladies neither smiled nor spoke . 
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened . 
I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . '' 
She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe , for she not only longed to be dancing , but was likewise aware that , as the real dignity of her situation could not be known , she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner . 
A Miss Hawkins of Bath . 
The same books , the same passages were idolized by each -- or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed . 
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . ” 
In one perhaps there may be a dagger , in another a few drops of blood , and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture ; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way , and your lamp being nearly exhausted , you will return towards your own apartment . 
Catherine , with a blush of mortification , left the house . 
He pressed for an answer . 
This was almost cruel . 
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive-branch . 
Catherine found that John Thorpe had given the message ; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it . 
Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . 
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it . 
Her parents , seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings , and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey , parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away ; and though , when they all met the next morning , her recovery was not equal to their hopes , they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil . 
“ But pray tell me what you mean . ” 
In her rambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself ; but in her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she had been before . 
I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . ” 
“ One was a very good-looking young man . ” 
He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it . ” 
A few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth , in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell . 
Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . 
He is still able to think and act ; and I write , by his desire , to propose your returning home . 
`` By feeling that I was doing my duty. -- My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret . 
To ease her mind , and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been , she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day . 
One likes to hear what is going on , to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . 
Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent. -- His reflections ended thus . 
; -- but no sooner had he deliberately begun to state his objections , than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all , whether stated or not . 
Call upon her , by all means . ” 
“ Indifferent ! 
Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day , or twice , if the subject occurred very often , by saying , `` It is very shocking , indeed ! '' 
By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it . ” 
I am so grieved for him ! 
Well , that is so very ! -- I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm. -- Mr . 
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . 
Do not you , Darcy ? ” 
repeated he ; `` would they have me beg my mother 's pardon for Robert 's ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME ? -- I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed. -- I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest. -- I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make . '' 
“ Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow ? ” 
She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard . 
“ Your father 's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think . 
This is such a comfort ! ” 
I went . 
Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after . 
It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth . 
Scarcely , however , had she convicted her fancy of error , when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start ; it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway -- and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it . 
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . 
A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands . 
`` Oh , ho ! -- I understand you . 
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . ” 
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 
“ Go into the law ! 
It seems an hopeless business . ” 
“ Merely to the illustration of _your_ character , ” said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . 
`` I am sure , '' replied Elinor , with a smile , `` that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . 
“ Really ! ” with affected astonishment . 
I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . 
He had communicated it to no creature : he had not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary ; while uncertain of the issue , he could not have borne any participation of his feelings , but this had been his business ; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been , and used such strong expressions , was so abounding in the _deepest_ _interest_ , in _twofold_ _motives_ , in _views_ _and_ _wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_ , that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift , had she been able to attend ; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished , that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William , and saying only when he paused , “ How kind ! 
But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses ; Henry drove so well -- so quietly -- without making any disturbance , without parading to her , or swearing at them : so different from the only gentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with ! 
I am sure , for my part , I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour , if he had not happened to say so . 
Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner . 
A sacrifice was always noble ; and if she had given way to their entreaties , she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased , a brother angry , and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed , perhaps through her means . 
An effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend . 
I could not but see that Mr. Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ” 
`` In a stationer 's shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . 
Her father was growing distressed for money . 
The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole 's did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride . 
“ This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy . 
You will be delighted with them I am sure . 
He trusted , however , that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one -- though not for himself . 
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . 
But it shows you the man . 
dear , no , ” said her companion . 
Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “ Yes ” ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour 's silent consideration spontaneously observed , “ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking -- and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did , for now the others are away we feel the good of it . ” 
He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as his aunt . 
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ” 
His aunt could not bear to have him leave her . 
All the best plays were run over in vain . 
He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place . 
I treat you without ceremony , Mr. Knightley . 
“ It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . ” 
She would see if it rained . 
Anything was possible , anything might be defied rather than suspense . 
No ; he was talking to Mrs. Cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole . 
Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . 
Their love of society , and their new dining-room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place . 
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella 's throat . ” 
“ Well , ” said Mrs. Weston , smiling , “ you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . 
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor -- when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine 's drawing-rooms , and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper 's room . 
`` I suspect , '' said Sir Walter coolly , `` that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall . 
She walked out directly , as her uncle recommended , and followed his advice throughout , as far as she could ; did check her tears ; did earnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind . 
By this time she is actually with them ! 
“ The Miss Owens -- you liked them , did not you ? ” 
`` Well , you will soon be better now , '' replied Anne , cheerfully . 
for he is forced to make every body like him . '' 
I was playing the fool with my eyes open . ” 
It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet 's coming to Hartfield . 
Can you be ? '' 
I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . 
Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately. -- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before. -- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post. -- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma. -- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal. -- “ Should not they walk ? 
This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred ; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind , she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once , propose going away , and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken . 
She returned it with pleasure , and then advancing still nearer , he spoke both to her and Mrs. Allen , by whom he was very civilly acknowledged . 
Fanny 's attractions increased -- increased twofold ; for the sensibility which beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an attraction in itself . 
Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined by all ; -- for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother 's consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT , than the immediate contraction of another . 
Upon her disposition he believed kindness might be the best way of working . 
And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person . 
She had given him up to oblige others . 
There , it is done . 
To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father 's account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls . 
A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . 
The whole party rose accordingly , and under Mrs. Rushworth 's guidance were shewn through a number of rooms , all lofty , and many large , and amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back , with shining floors , solid mahogany , rich damask , marble , gilding , and carving , each handsome in its way . 
I have no business to put myself forward . ” 
In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when Marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door . 
You would have doated on her , had you gone. -- But not a word more . 
“ Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? ” 
We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . 
We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted . 
“ That is as it happens . 
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . 
“ But is it like what one reads of ? ” 
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? 
He will connect himself well if he can . ” 
Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . ” 
Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him ! -- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could ! -- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? ” 
He has been very deceitful ! 
I have nothing to say against _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 
It was truly dramatic . 
“ _I_ should have no objection , ” she replied ; “ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_ ” ( looking round ) , “ it certainly will not be taken . ” 
“ Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before. -- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . 
CHAPTER VI 
My cousin is grown up . 
Ah ! 
`` And yet I do assure you , '' replied Lucy , her little sharp eyes full of meaning , `` there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . 
_I_ do not wish to make objections ; I shall be happy to be of any use , but I think we could not chuse worse . ” 
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . 
`` Who ! 
It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours . 
When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . '' 
“ Very well , ” replied Emma ; “ a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased . 
I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . 
Each behaving so pleasantly . 
“ What ! ” cried Edmund ; “ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma'am ? 
She is a good-hearted girl as ever lived. -- Very well upon my word . 
Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , “ Oh ! 
“ It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . ” 
On receiving it , she could instantly decide on its containing little writing , and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste and business . 
Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon . 
“ My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ” said her mother at last ; “ depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ” 
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . 
Agatha and Amelia appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home representation -- the situation of one , and the language of the other , so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty , that she could hardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in ; and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make . 
What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them ! 
how poor they will be ! -- I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house . 
Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . 
“ I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ” 
It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment ! -- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people 's not staying comfortably at home when they can ! 
Something must be fixed on . 
Mr. Rushworth mentioned his curricle . 
From that moment I observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . 
Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and , to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . 
As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same . 
Where is it ? 
But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise , for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name , as Miss Steele had in hearing it . 
Crawford had been too precipitate . 
I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , 'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . ' 
“ If it was to be secret , ” said Jane , “ say not another word on the subject . 
Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both . 
Chapter 20 
I see her instrument is open . '' 
She shuddered , tossed about in her bed , and envied every quiet sleeper . 
“ My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . 
Is she handsome ? ” 
It does for everything . 
What can you have to do with hearts ? 
“ It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together . ” 
He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . 
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair . 
I shall be at your service in half a minute . '' 
For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received . 
When she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings . 
Chapter 33 
How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life ! ” 
`` Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton 's style of painting , Ma'am ? -- She DOES paint most delightfully ! -- How beautifully her last landscape is done ! '' 
you are not serious now . 
A variety of evils crossed his mind . 
Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters , the situation of some , the growth of the rest , and other family matters now passed between them , and continued , with only one small digression on James 's part , in praise of Miss Thorpe , till they reached Pulteney Street , where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen , invited by the former to dine with them , and summoned by the latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet . 
Do not think of me as I appeared then . ” 
What else can detain him at Norland ? '' 
“ What shall we do ? 
It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter. -- Ha ! 
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . 
She hated herself more than she could express . 
Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , 
“ And pray , may I ask ? -- ” But checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone , “ Is it in address that he improves ? 
Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again -- “ Mr . 
Fanny 's rides recommenced the very next day ; and as it was a pleasant fresh-feeling morning , less hot than the weather had lately been , Edmund trusted that her losses , both of health and pleasure , would be soon made good . 
If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . ” 
The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . 
It is a pity that they were ever got over . ” 
“ Yes , almost every day . ” 
Everybody is taken in at some period or other . ” 
“ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . 
`` Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . 
Heaven forbid ! 
In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland 's personal and mental endowments , when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks ' residence in Bath , it may be stated , for the reader 's more certain information , lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be , that her heart was affectionate ; her disposition cheerful and open , without conceit or affectation of any kind -- her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl ; her person pleasing , and , when in good looks , pretty -- and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is . 
It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin . 
He is here , of course . 
In the first place , William was gone . 
She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . 
As they walked across the hall towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . 
We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . 
We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . 
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all . 
Having introduced him , however , and being all reseated , the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering , and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away . 
“ We are not calling it a good house , ” said he . 
Who is your party ? '' 
`` Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . 
This letter is from Mr. Collins . ” 
Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler 's shops which they passed . 
In the king 's service , of course ? ” 
I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . 
I am sure she would argue so . 
But gracious me ! 
His card was on the table when they came in from the morning 's drive . 
_There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . 
“ I found , ” said he , “ as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ” 
I would not take eight hundred guineas for them . 
But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . 
But , however , that sha n't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . 
Mr. Crawford gone , Sir Thomas 's next object was that he should be missed ; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank in the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt , or fancied , an evil . 
Scarcely had she so determined it , when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window . 
On the beginning of the fifth , however , the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father , joining a party in the opposite box , recalled her to anxiety and distress . 
She had met him , he said , with a serious -- certainly a serious -- even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him . 
On the strength of Darcy 's regard , Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgement the highest opinion . 
Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress . 
_What_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10,000 l. , it did not appear that she was at all Harriet 's superior . 
“ And _your_ defect is to hate everybody . ” 
Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him . 
He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body 's returning into their proper place the next morning . 
It will exactly suit my cross . 
Emma could not resist . 
Delighting , however , as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the connection , it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations . 
For one letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat . 
Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley . 
It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death . 
While he spoke , Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this : so contrary to all their first protestations ; but Edmund said nothing . 
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 
Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! ” 
“ Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . 
A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . ” 
It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; -- it is disposition alone . 
Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character . 
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Phillips , appears to do so much credit to -- but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . 
He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse , as well as Emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at Donwell , be tempted away to his misery . 
Marianne got up and walked about the room . 
“ You are a good girl ; ” he replied , “ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 
He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife 's occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne 's admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ) , they might pass for a happy couple . 
He came to them every day . 
At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . 
that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! 
He spoke calmly , however , without austerity , without reproach , and she revived a little . 
It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella 's brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure . 
“ The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . 
`` I do assure you , '' he replied , `` that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . 
But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything . 
“ I am the less surprised at what has happened , ” replied Sir William , “ from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . 
“ But I was embarrassed . ” 
Catherine , by some chance or other , found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on , though so unaccountably , to mention the circumstance which had produced it . 
but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley 's chaise to go to Meryton , and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . ” 
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . 
But even then there was something odd in their way of going on . 
They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove 's , for the little boy 's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings . 
Come along with me , and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room ; my two younger sisters and their partners . 
But it was possible to part with her , because Susan remained to supply her place . 
I will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father 's answer . 
She certainly understands _you_ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _many_ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it . 
Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned . 
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . 
He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill 's engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her. -- The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings . 
They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England . 
All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . '' 
And was not it odd that he should always take his walk so early ? 
We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . 
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it “ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ” and , before she could reply , he added , “ It is above eight months . 
“ If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet -- But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act -- no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough . 
Look at my shoes . 
There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantily furnished chamber that she was to share with Susan . 
Others of the party were now applied to . 
“ I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ” 
and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? 
I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney -- 'a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . ' 
I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall , '' ( with a kind bow to Anne ) , `` beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether . '' 
Mrs. Weston looked surprized , and said , “ I did not know that he ever had any such plan . ” 
Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it. -- Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it . '' 
Do not you see it in the same light ? ” 
Only three of us. -- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . 
This was astonishing ! -- She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer . 
“ Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better . 
“ Shall I ? ” Drawing her arm within his . 
I have no common interest in Crawford 's well-doing . 
`` To be sure it would . '' 
But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages , in self-condemnation for Robert 's offence , and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . 
“ My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , ” said Frank Churchill , “ examining the capabilities of the house . 
My mother often talks of your good-nature . 
Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat . 
She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith 's . 
How well you put it on ! -- so gratified ! 
The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . 
Can not you imagine , Mr. Knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ? 
And to ask me in such a way too ! 
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs. Forster , the delight of Mrs. Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described . 
My own Betsey ” ( fondling her ) , “ _you_ have not the luck of such a good godmother . 
`` Where shall we go ? '' 
“ I am very glad I did think of her . 
And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law . 
This is not the place for explanations . 
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips 's manners and politeness . 
You will both find your good in it . ” 
A heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment , as no attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand . 
Happy Julia ! 
Elinor 's office was a painful one. -- She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister 's chief consolation , -- to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion , -and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . 
It takes me quite unawares . 
“ My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . 
“ I wish your heart were independent . 
I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . 
She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . 
After her entrance , Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before , and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long . 
“ Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . 
Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . 
But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . 
`` Four years ! '' 
Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery . 
“ No , I believe not . ” 
Lady Bertram 's being just on the other side of the table was a trifle , for she might always be considered as only half-awake , and Edmund 's advertisements were still of the first utility . 
Marianne was in a silent agony , too much oppressed even for tears ; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home , they could go directly to their own room , where hartshorn restored her a little to herself . 
`` Colonel Brandon ! '' 
`` You have heard , I suppose , '' said he with great solemnity , as soon as he was seated , `` of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday . '' 
What could they have to say of her ? 
That any bookseller should think it worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to publish seems extraordinary . 
But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches . 
The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father . 
The King , the Queen , Buckingham , Wolsey , Cromwell , all were given in turn ; for with the happiest knack , the happiest power of jumping and guessing , he could always alight at will on the best scene , or the best speeches of each ; and whether it were dignity , or pride , or tenderness , or remorse , or whatever were to be expressed , he could do it with equal beauty . 
Mr. Rushworth had set off early with the great news for Sotherton ; and she had fondly hoped for such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him the trouble of ever coming back again . 
No other visitor appeared that evening , and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed . 
I shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you . 
And what claims has Lydia -- what attraction has she beyond youth , health , and good humour that could make him , for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? 
I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . 
He had passed out of the room without a look ! 
Elinor was not inclined , after a little observation , to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear . 
Jennings , with a very intelligent `` Ah ! 
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . ” 
It is a pity you could not all go . ” 
But she is really quite the gentlewoman . ” 
This , and Marianne 's blushing , gave new suspicions to Edward . 
`` I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer 's , where I have been dining . '' 
Her spirits sank . 
It is a most interesting work . 
We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . ” 
The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease : whatever she touched she expected to injure , and she crept about in constant terror of something or other ; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry ; and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune , ended every day 's sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep . 
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed : 
Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . 
“ And Lydia used to want to go to London , ” added Kitty . 
Her going roused the rest ; and at the same moment the two brothers stepped forward , feeling the necessity of doing something . 
My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better . 
Of _Rears_ and _Vices_ I saw enough . 
Oh ! 
His niece , meanwhile , did not thank him for what he had just done . 
He took out his watch : “ How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? ” 
“ Come , Fanny , Fanny , what are you about ? 
Those who do not complain are never pitied . ” 
I had been looking about me in the poultry-yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants ' hall-door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them . 
I had quite determined to go away again . ” 
This was the season of happiness to Marianne . 
His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . 
Fortune is nothing . 
This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . 
As she said this , she looked directly at her companion . 
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . 
After all that she had heard him say , and seen him look , and known him to be feeling . 
Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it . 
Mrs. Bennet 's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , 
“ But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . ” 
I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . ” 
He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . 
Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her . 
I am prodigiously proud of him . 
Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a-year . 
She would not , upon any account , mention her having met with him the second time ; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk , but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne 's having actually run against him in the passage , and received his very polite excuses , while she had never been near him at all ; no , that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret . 
she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . 
If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . 
They were excessively sorry to go ! 
God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover. -- But you understand me. -- Yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can . 
Was this like wishing to avoid her ? 
My feelings in every respect forbid it . 
Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible . 
And Mrs . 
Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ; -- and two basins only were ordered . 
Why could he not keep on quarreling with you , as his father did before him ? ” 
On the contrary , with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest , she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit , anticipating the pleasure of Margaret 's return , and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored , of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society , as the only happiness worth a wish . 
She had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes , and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work , move Pug from her side , and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband . 
“ It is a sort of thing , ” cried Mrs. Elton emphatically , “ which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . 
Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions , and acting on them in defiance of her ( and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball ) , she could not help thinking of him continually when absent , dwelling on his merit and affection , and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had . 
She saw him grave and uneasy ; and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart , to her it was always an object . 
Were _she_ likely to have a home to invite her to , what a blessing it would be ! 
No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time. -- A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers . 
The two friends , with hearts now more united than ever , were inseparable for the day ; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along . 
Yes , I suppose he may . 
I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . 
Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma 's . 
“ Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? ” 
Not so the Miss Steeles. -- They came from Exeter , well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton , his family , and all his relations , and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. -- And to be better acquainted therefore , Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day . 
She was all attention , however , in placing a chair for him , and trying to appear honoured ; and , in her agitation , had quite overlooked the deficiencies of her apartment , till he , stopping short as he entered , said , with much surprise , “ Why have you no fire to-day ? ” 
What shall we do to rouse them ? 
`` Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma'am , '' said Elinor , `` we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . '' 
Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step , and a look of such happy importance , as engaged all her friend 's notice . 
As the horse continued in name , as well as fact , the property of Edmund , Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny 's use ; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again , he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas 's return in September , for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad , and without any near prospect of finishing his business . 
He knew not that he had a pre-engaged heart to attack . 
“ I have sent for you on an affair of importance . 
“ So very kind ! ” replied Miss Bates . 
She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap . 
“ But perhaps you would like to read it . ” 
Yet it did , and even a third . 
`` I had none . 
“ Oh ! 
I could not have believed it ! 
Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed ; -- and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . 
But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney , whenever he made his application , would give his father any just idea of Isabella 's conduct , it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was , enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion , and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations . 
My friend Sneyd -- you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund -- his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me . 
Money , money , was all that he wanted . 
“ Cautious , very cautious , ” thought Emma ; “ he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure . ” 
I certainly do not go home to-night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly . ” 
The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . '' 
“ Good Heaven ! 
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self-reproach . 
“ Is my father in town ? ” 
The fever was over , and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy . 
As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . 
Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward 's behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce , -- with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . 
By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife , who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years . 
“ Mamma , ” cried Lydia , “ my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson 's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke 's library . ” 
But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . 
I told my sister Phillips so the other day . 
Chapter 12 
With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it . 
“ Is not this most vexatious , Knightley ? ” she cried. -- “ And such weather for exploring ! -- These delays and disappointments are quite odious . 
“ Insufferable woman ! ” was her immediate exclamation . 
Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once . ” 
“ You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night ; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 
The old lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit . 
Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done , on the part of the Morlands , with a degree of moderation and composure , which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life , than with the refined susceptibilities , the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite . 
`` Yes , yes , I see you are . 
-- 
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature . 
She could not think that Harriet 's solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ; -- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- “ Mr . 
“ You need not be frightened . 
yes . 
A few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said , 
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria 's astonishment at her being so thin and so small . 
Pray explain everything to his satisfaction ; or , if he still harbours any doubt , a line from himself to me , or a call at Putney when next in town , might set all to rights . 
She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton ; and Harriet 's mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength . 
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr. Darcy . 
The kind-hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy . 
Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure . 
Have patience with me , I shall soon have done. -- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again. -- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_. -- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt 's death . 
Marianne restored to life , health , friends , and to her doting mother , was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort , and expand it in fervent gratitude ; -- but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy , no words , no smiles . 
How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ” 
`` But how shall we prove anything ? '' 
If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry . ” 
He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance . 
Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no disinclination to the state herself . 
“ It is impossible for me to doubt any longer . 
Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride . 
Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , an hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . 
`` No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . 
Miss Price is not out . ” 
Miss Bertram was the one . 
“ If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying . 
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs ; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . 
Is this fair , Mrs . 
what is the matter ? ” cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , “ I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . 
No signs that a 'Scottish monarch sleeps below . 
All connection between us seemed now dissolved . 
With such a regard for her , indeed , as his had long been , a regard founded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness , and completed by every recommendation of growing worth , what could be more natural than the change ? 
Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . ” 
They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . ” 
I can be ready by seven . 
Anne could not help laughing . 
The malady itself , one from which she had often suffered , a bilious fever -- its cause therefore constitutional . 
“ I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . 
“ Six years hence ! 
`` I am sorry I do NOT , '' said Elinor , in great astonishment , `` if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . 
“ Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . 
A few days passed away , and Catherine , though not allowing herself to suspect her friend , could not help watching her closely . 
Chapter 24 
Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . 
He had left the country in consequence . 
I must get rid of every thing. -- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! 
Mrs. Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home . 
“ MY DEAR BROTHER , 
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ” 
“ She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . 
For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be ” ( here was a glance at Fanny ) ; “ that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . 
“ And I certainly _never_ shall give it . 
I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . 
“ No . ” 
There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height . 
When she is secure of him , there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ” 
Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband . 
She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . 
Elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour , was saying -- 
Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . 
Emma 's courage returned , and she walked on . 
More was not expected by one who , while seeing all the obligation and expediency of submission and forbearance , saw also with sympathetic acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a girl like Susan . 
“ You are ungrateful . ” 
And as to making me an offer , or anything like it , there must be some unaccountable mistake . 
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . 
If her sisters intended to walk on the downs , she directly stole away towards the lanes ; if they talked of the valley , she was as speedy in climbing the hills , and could never be found when the others set off . 
The key was in the door , and she had a strange fancy to look into it ; not , however , with the smallest expectation of finding anything , but it was so very odd , after what Henry had said . 
Sit down , my dear . 
You only mean , that he intends it . ” 
Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . 
He spoke to her , and then turned away . 
Ladies can never look ill. And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health. -- A most deplorable want of complexion . ” 
“ And only made believe to do so for mischief 's sake ? ” 
Henry bowed his assent . 
But it appears -- I should hope it would be a very happy match . 
Elinor , though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon , could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away , which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling ; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation , her wonder was otherwise disposed of . 
No , indeed , I can not act . ” 
He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . 
Mrs. Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper 's room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne . 
CHAPTER XVI 
Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth was careless and cold . 
The child of good fortune ! 
Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake . 
“ I know nothing of the Miss Owens , ” said Fanny calmly . 
An engagement , you know , must be kept . 
And it was entirely for HER sake , and upon HER account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . 
They have been leading her astray for years . 
His charitable kindness had been rearing a prime comfort for himself . 
It would be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples ; and as she looked around her , the claims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present that she had received from them . 
very well , ” exclaimed Miss Bates , “ then I need not be uneasy . 
In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 
He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said , 
That she might not appear , however , to observe or expect him , she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan ; and a self-condemnation for her folly , in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time , had just passed through her mind , when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance , by Mr. Tilney himself . 
Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England ; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his son , and waiting the final arrangement by himself . 
At present I will say nothing about it . ” 
to put me on my guard ? 
Harriet had no penetration . 
He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her. -- Emma saw it . 
Miss Tilney , to whom this was chiefly addressed , was startled , and hastily replied , “ Indeed ! 
The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties . 
“ The person of whom I speak is a gentleman , and a stranger . ” 
“ Have you never been there ? 
However small Elinor 's general dependence on Lucy 's veracity might be , it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case , where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description . 
`` Even so . 
I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare . ” 
`` At Marlborough ! '' 
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? ” 
“ You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right. -- I am not in want of that sort of compassion . 
But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . 
Emma 's pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her . 
Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self-reproach , which must attend her through life . 
“ But you are always kind . ” 
“ I beg your pardon , I will try again . 
This was the first time of her brother 's openly siding against her , and anxious to avoid his displeasure , she proposed a compromise . 
Mrs. Norris almost started . 
That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness . 
He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates 's , I fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour. -- He was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before. -- In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of -- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal . ” 
Elizabeth could not help saying , “ It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . ” 
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet 's side , as there could be any occasion for . 
“ And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! 
`` Are you going as high as Belmont ? 
A woman especially , if she have the misfortune of knowing anything , should conceal it as well as she can . 
The winter came and passed without their being called for ; the accounts continued perfectly good ; and Mrs. Norris , in promoting gaieties for her nieces , assisting their toilets , displaying their accomplishments , and looking about for their future husbands , had so much to do as , in addition to all her own household cares , some interference in those of her sister , and Mrs. Grant 's wasteful doings to overlook , left her very little occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent . 
Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles 's following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it . 
She saw her mother and Marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other . 
Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . '' 
Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love . 
We are going to Lord Longtown 's , near Hereford , for a fortnight . 
Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . 
I am sure it almost killed me once . ” 
“ Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . ” 
She started at its import . 
Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton 's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand . 
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . 
She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton 's thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax 's confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . 
“ She is a most charming young lady indeed . 
Mr. Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase . 
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business , had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty . 
Amelia should be a small , light , girlish , skipping figure . 
“ You are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . 
“ Both ! 
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband . 
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . ” 
Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury . 
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 
He rose up , and walked across the room . 
Perry ! -- such attention to Jane ! ” -- And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome. -- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs. Elton , speaking louder , said , 
The parties stood thus : 
Lady Bertram made no objection ; and every one concerned in the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence , excepting Edmund , who heard it all and said nothing . 
“ I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , ” said he , “ and am sure of giving pleasure there . 
She certainly did not hate him . 
I began to think I should never see you . 
“ Did not you ? 
Here was a blow ! 
Only to Honiton . 
“ Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long . ” 
Could there have been any unpleasant glances ? 
How is she to-day ? 
Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . 
“ If that be all your difficulty , I will furnish you with paper and every other material , and you may write your letter whenever you choose . 
What a very good-looking man ! '' 
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . 
The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart ; and , as they walked , Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score of James 's disappointment . 
She was privy , one evening , to the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject , as well as to her feelings , and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth , on a point of some similarity , and could not help wondering as she listened ; and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen , for it was while all the other young people were dancing , and she sitting , most unwillingly , among the chaperons at the fire , longing for the re-entrance of her elder cousin , on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended . 
It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . 
She blessed the favouring blindness . 
Sir John Middleton , who called on them every day for the first fortnight , and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home , could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed . 
They are always acting upon motives of vanity , and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public than afterwards . ” 
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother 's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? 
But I need not ask you , for you look delightfully . 
But what does he say of the living ? ” 
Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth -- 
And now here 's Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? 
She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole 's door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley 's ; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma 's opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey . 
Look ! 
Mr. Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in . 
Colonel Wallis said it , and Lady Russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice . 
Poor Fanny 's mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its varieties . 
`` Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard . 
It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston , as he grew older -- and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs. Weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again . 
I am sure I have not got one half so good . ” 
But Marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up . 
Anne 's good-will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . 
I never could have supposed it . 
She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantelpiece . 
It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . 
Look at her . 
It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do . 
“ Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . ” 
Ah ! 
Her brother , she found , was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton , to make known his situation and ask consent ; and here was a source of some real agitation to the mind of Isabella . 
After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes , Fanny , feeling it due to herself , returned to Mr. Crawford , and said , “ It is not merely in _temper_ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _that_ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . 
“ My dear , ” interrupted Sir Thomas , “ there is no occasion for this . 
They walked off , utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth 's repeated question of , “ Shall I go too ? 
“ She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . 
“ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ” said he , “ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then . 
The others returned , the room filled again , benches were reclaimed and repossessed , and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out , another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes , as real or affected taste for it prevailed . 
What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body 's eating it . 
I did not know what to do . 
They were hopeless of remedy . 
Indeed he has no improper pride . 
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . 
it does not signify . 
Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it . 
She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . ” 
He should have worked upon my plans . 
Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced . 
Under this infatuating principle , counteracted by no real affection for her sister , it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity ; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the Parsonage , after this conversation , in the happy belief of being the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world . 
“ Have you , indeed ! 
do n't be in such a hurry . 
“ Undoubtedly , ” replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , “ there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . 
So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral 's situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . 
It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . '' 
-- But this note made me know myself better . 
And so you are going to Northanger ! 
“ Why , as to _that_ , my good friend , till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork ; but I mean no disparagement to Julia . 
To Elizabeth it appeared that , had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . 
Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly . 
He took the hint , and soon began with , “ This seems a very comfortable house . 
Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _her_ good-nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted . 
After wandering about and sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings , he had so well talked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again . 
Here were funds of enjoyment . 
`` Your sister 's marriage . '' 
Three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles ! 
He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ” 
That is his notion of Christian forgiveness ! 
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection . 
Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . 
If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . 
She had some extra visits from the housekeeper , and her maid was rather hurried in making up a new dress for her : Sir Thomas gave orders , and Mrs. Norris ran about ; but all this gave _her_ no trouble , and as she had foreseen , “ there was , in fact , no trouble in the business . ” 
And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon , -- but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . '' 
Her sensibility was potent enough ! 
`` Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . 
`` I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . 
She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room , by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively . 
I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names . 
I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . '' 
It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never be wrong . 
I would rather not be tempted . 
“ There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . 
Lydia was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 
I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . ” 
“ I -- I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ” 
After dinner she would try her piano-forte . 
Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . 
“ Oh ! 
“ Now , Edmund , do not be disagreeable , ” said Julia . 
Well , she was taken away from evil to come . 
But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . 
“ Oh , no ; they will never think of me , after such a description as that . ” 
If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . 
There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere. -- She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_ . 
“ This has been a strange acquaintance , ” observed Mrs. Morland , as the letter was finished ; “ soon made and soon ended . 
My beloved creature , what do you mean ? ” 
“ Oh ! 
“ Design ! 
Tell me more . 
This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . 
“ For if , ” said he , with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a clearer head does not always avoid , “ we are _too_ long going over the house , we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors . 
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . 
`` Why , to be sure , '' said her husband , very gravely , `` that would make great difference . 
This was too much . 
Between Barton and Delaford , there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate ; -- and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne , let it not be ranked as the least considerable , that though sisters , and living almost within sight of each other , they could live without disagreement between themselves , or producing coolness between their husbands . 
Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . 
Now for my soliloquy . ” 
The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . 
But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . 
CHAPTER XI 
They have not seen two such drawing rooms before . 
She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris , and an order for post-horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother . 
There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make her better bear with its excesses to the others . 
He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable. -- The furniture was all sent around by water . 
But the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort . 
You spoke of the balls at Northampton . 
We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire -- nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows , doors , or furniture . 
It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say . 
I think I see you coming in with your basket . ” 
For nine successive mornings , Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment , which each morning became more severe : but , on the tenth , when she entered the breakfast-room , her first object was a letter , held out by Henry 's willing hand . 
Their reception at home was most kind . 
“ What was her father ? ” 
His opinion of Louisa Musgrove 's inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at Captain Benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . 
He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . 
She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . 
I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n't think how disappointed he will be if you do n't come to Cleveland. -- I ca n't imagine why you should object to it . '' 
Her plan for the morning thus settled , she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast , resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one ; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen , whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such , that as she never talked a great deal , so she could never be entirely silent ; and , therefore , while she sat at her work , if she lost her needle or broke her thread , if she heard a carriage in the street , or saw a speck upon her gown , she must observe it aloud , whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not . 
“ Indeed you did . 
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . ” 
It was a very proper wedding . 
Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade . 
That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . 
my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . 
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it . 
He smiled , and said , “ You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey . ” 
If two moments , however , can surround with difficulties , a third can disperse them ; and before she had opened the letter , the possibility of Mr. and Miss Crawford 's having applied to her uncle and obtained his permission was giving her ease . 
If you look across the street , you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother . 
He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . 
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved ; and from his judgement , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance . 
Good God ! 
“ Yes , and the Bear . 
“ No , indeed you are mistaken. ” -- 
She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind . 
97 , Vol . 
“ Mr . 
“ You do quite right , ” said she ; -- “ we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . ” 
-- 
“ Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . ” 
She has known him only a fortnight . 
Such a heart -- such a Harriet ! 
“ He did . 
She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . '' 
Mr. Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . 
Still , however , it was her private regale . 
I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable . 
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . 
Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . 
“ I am afraid Jane is not very well , ” said she , “ but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well . 
She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . 
It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness , his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law 's rights would have given . 
You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . 
But , however , I hope you will think better of it . 
then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse. -- 'Aye , pray do , ' said Mr. Frank Churchill , 'Miss Woodhouse 's opinion of the instrument will be worth having . ' 
Finding by whom he was observed , Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject to Sir Thomas , in a more everyday tone , but still with feeling . 
If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . 
“ Ah ! 
“ She had set out from Mrs. Goddard 's half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford's. ” -- Ford 's was the principal woollen-draper , linen-draper , and haberdasher 's shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place. -- “ And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd ! -- but they always dealt at Ford 's -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother ! -- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! 
He asked me if he could do any thing ... . ” 
Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ; -- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax 's situation with Mr . 
How can you be so cross as not to come ? 
“ I certainly do forget to think of _her_ , ” said Emma , “ as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . ” 
In every other respect , in looking around her , or penetrating forward , she saw more to distrust and to apprehend . 
When she had been coming to Portsmouth , she had loved to call it her home , had been fond of saying that she was going home ; the word had been very dear to her , and so it still was , but it must be applied to Mansfield . 
`` I am afraid , Miss Marianne , '' said Sir John , `` you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . '' 
How can you ? -- But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . '' 
She could say no more ; her breath was almost gone . 
The morrow brought a very sober-looking morning , the sun making only a few efforts to appear , and Catherine augured from it everything most favourable to her wishes . 
So far from being all satisfied and all enjoying , she found everybody requiring something they had not , and giving occasion of discontent to the others . 
He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries , but without satisfying her in any . 
When Sir Thomas understood this , he felt the necessity of making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business without delay ; though , on Fanny 's account , he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself . 
“ You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . ” 
“ Oh yes ! 
“ Poor dears ! 
Your uncle ! 
“ And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ? -- The Campbells , the Dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ? ” 
But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser 's party ; his staying was made of flattering consequence , and he was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there . 
“ But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one 's family circle grievously . ” 
`` Not yet , '' cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , `` but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . 
What have you got on ? ” 
I dare say they are trying for it . 
There was snow on the ground , and she was sitting in a shawl . 
Go , and interfere . 
The place of all places , the envied seat , the post of honour , was unappropriated . 
Oh ! 
The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind. -- He saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it . 
He knew nothing about it ; but his father , like every military man , had a very large acquaintance . 
Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . 
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . ” 
I shall sit by you . 
Why does not he try Bath ? -- Indeed he should . 
It must not be , if by any fair interference of friendship , any representations from one who had almost a mother 's love , and mother 's rights , it would be prevented . 
“ Yes , ” added Maria , “ and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . 
`` And so YOU are forced to do it . 
“ But I do look down upon it , if it might have been higher . 
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . ” 
She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . 
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . 
THAT I will never consent to . 
And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . '' 
“ That you do not give another half-second to the subject . 
“ To be sure . 
She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about . 
`` Charles may say what he pleases , '' cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , `` but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt that he has . 
He was only too good to everybody . 
He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual . 
A man like him , in his situation ! 
There was a little hesitation in Emma 's answer . 
I hope he will overlook it . 
And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . 
Weston. -- “ Very well , I thank you , ma'am . 
We do not often look upon fine young men , well-bred and agreeable . 
But here , one subject swallowed up all the rest . 
It would be an excellent match , for HE was rich , and SHE was handsome . 
“ I must go instantly to my mother ; ” she cried . 
“ I admire the activity of your benevolence , ” observed Mary , “ but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ” 
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . 
The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised , at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at Mary 's particular invitation . 
As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta . 
I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . 
That 's the worst of him . '' 
His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done . 
Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick , but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself ; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two . 
“ No ; not quite a month . 
“ Mr . 
Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin 's prose . 
Nobody could tell . 
You do not wish me to be silent ? 
Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness or rusticity , a sister 's husband who looked the gentleman , and a house commodious and well fitted up ; and Mrs. Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance . 
“ Thank God , ” said he . 
was Sir Walter 's cold suspicious inquiry . 
“ I come from your theatre , ” said he composedly , as he sat down ; “ I found myself in it rather unexpectedly . 
He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . '' 
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ” 
Poor James ! 
“ I shall find it immediately. ” And by carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves , he did find it , or within a page or two , quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram , who assured him , as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey , that he had got the very speech . 
Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise . 
She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . 
She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . 
But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . 
Elinor 's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 's . 
But then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? 
“ Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . ” 
But that is not the case _here_ . 
I am excessively attentive to all those things . 
Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . 
I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . 
He now wished it more than ever . 
For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? '' 
A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness , and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together ; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet . 
“ Mr . 
We did very well without them . ” 
They vindicated him against the base aspersion . 
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . 
Charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account . 
Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other . 
Man 's boasted power and freedom , all are flown . 
I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . 
What a head you have ! 
How can they suit each other ? 
Will you not sit down ? 
“ I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . 
no -- it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . 
“ I comfort myself with thinking , ” replied Jane , “ that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her . 
Mrs. Price , Rebecca , and Betsey all went up to defend themselves , all talking together , but Rebecca loudest , and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry ; William trying in vain to send Betsey down again , or keep her from being troublesome where she was ; the whole of which , as almost every door in the house was open , could be plainly distinguished in the parlour , except when drowned at intervals by the superior noise of Sam , Tom , and Charles chasing each other up and down stairs , and tumbling about and hallooing . 
These are points in which a doubt is equally possible . 
Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings ; -- she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others ; -- represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . 
`` It is very true . 
As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can . 
Good heaven ! 
He was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation . 
We were principally in town , living in very good style . 
`` Indeed I believe you , '' replied Elinor ; `` but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME . '' 
ay , -- Mr Wentworth , the curate of Monkford . 
The former was for Sir John 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady . 
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . 
Here Mr. Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation . 
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , 
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 
“ That is a fair remark . 
“ Oh dear , no , ma'am , nobody suspected you ! 
Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . 
Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son-in-law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy. -- She had some fears of his horse . 
They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening . 
She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself . 
“ You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her . 
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion , too ! 
These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies . 
I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; ” and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they were moving again at a good pace . 
Perhaps , ” turning to Miss Crawford , “ my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . ” 
When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence . 
She only consulted Lady Russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith 's lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as Anne chose to be taken . 
“ Mrs . 
She believed he was very clever , and understood every thing . 
You give me fresh life and vigour . 
“ When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character -- Oh ! 
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation -- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street . 
The rain was a mere trifle , and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot . 
The girls stared at their father . 
*Vide a letter from Mr. Richardson , No . 
“ Oh ! 
CHAPTER II 
He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . 
She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . 
Do n't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side . 
A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? 
While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ? -- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected. -- I was mad enough , however , to resent. -- I doubted her affection . 
If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! 
Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . 
Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill-usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate. -- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . 
It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . '' 
“ Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . 
It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted . 
`` If you would but let us know what your business is , '' said Mrs. Jennings , `` we might see whether it could be put off or not . '' 
I am amazingly absent ; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world . 
Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh . 
“ They are blended , ” said he , “ I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . 
I do not believe I did you any good . 
without partiality ; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated -- ! 
I absolutely can not do without music . 
Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 
It was the end of an old pencil , -- the part without any lead . 
He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character . 
“ Never , sir . ” 
Are you going much farther ? ” 
Then , however , it all came on again , or something very like it , and nothing less than Lady Bertram 's rousing thoroughly up could really close such a conversation . 
She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . '' 
Chapter 3 
“ I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees , because I can never bear to ask ; but I have not told you that , with my usual luck -- for I never do wrong without gaining by it -- I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see . 
The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet 's welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security. -- What had she to wish for ? 
With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen . 
Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love . 
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange . 
Did Admiral Crawford apply ? 
It was reasonable , however , to hope that they would not continue long . 
What is her character ? 
I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card-table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . '' 
Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired . 
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations ; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . 
Every body is lazy ! 
“ You are so like your dear brother , ” continued Isabella , “ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . 
Her brother was not handsome : no , when they first saw him he was absolutely plain , black and plain ; but still he was the gentleman , with a pleasing address . 
“ Money ! 
I certainly get better and better. -- Now for it . ” 
Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . ” 
Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . 
He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . '' 
Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it . 
“ Lizzy , ” said her father , “ I have given him my consent . 
“ This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother 's fortitude , ” observed the general to Eleanor . 
“ And had you really some at hand yourself ? 
This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove 's coach containing the four ladies , and Charles 's curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . 
Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . '' 
“ Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd ! 
Maria , wanting Henry Crawford 's animating support , thought the subject better avoided . 
Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary . 
Happily for her , they were not many . 
Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever . '' 
You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference . ” 
“ That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates ! 
`` Writing to each other , '' said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , `` is the only comfort we have in such long separations . 
`` Oh , Lord ! 
But it is unnecessary here . 
`` I must not tell , ma'am . 
I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . '' 
“ The very picture of him indeed ! ” cried the mother -- and “ I should have known her anywhere for his sister ! ” was repeated by them all , two or three times over . 
“ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ” said he , as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit ; “ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ” 
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . 
that 's a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . 
Elinor smiled , and shook her head . 
It was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . 
He had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at Hartfield . 
Her uncle 's displeasure was terrible to her ; but what could her justification or her gratitude and attachment do for him ? 
Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . ” 
How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! 
“ To be sure we do , ” cried his father ; “ Mrs . 
Adieu ! 
We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here . ” 
The tete-a-tete surprised them . 
We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . '' 
He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them . 
I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . 
Edmund knocked at her door in his way to his own . 
How I should like such a house for myself ! 
I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . 
No misfortune occurred , again to prevent the ball . 
Under his government , Mansfield was an altered place . 
“ I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . 
Circumstances change , opinions alter . ” 
Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane 's beauty . 
Elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . 
“ Oh ! ” said she , “ I heard you before , but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . 
She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious . 
`` I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles , for I can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . 
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 
`` No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . 
His revenge would have been complete indeed . 
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . 
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 
For the rest of his character and habits , they were marked , as far as Elinor could perceive , with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life . 
Very odd ! 
“ My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak , as to be in danger now ? ” 
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room . 
If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone . 
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light . 
Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly . 
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully . 
“ Oh , Jane , take care . ” 
And to be having any one 's improvement in view in her choice ! 
And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . ” 
But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . '' 
Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it . 
The storm still raged , and various were the noises , more terrific even than the wind , which struck at intervals on her startled ear . 
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the “ poor little boys , ” or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it . 
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . 
Edmund , you do not know me . 
I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . 
Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life . ” 
She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne ; Anne , who was nothing to Louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in Henrietta 's stead ! 
They were all thoughtless or indolent . 
While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . 
Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . 
If the Rushworths were gone themselves to Mansfield , as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said , it was not likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them , or at least should make any impression . 
The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . '' 
I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . 
We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . 
I can not be dictated to by a watch . ” 
Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? ” 
“ My dearest Henry , ” cried Mary , stopping short , and smiling in his face , “ how glad I am to see you so much in love ! 
Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her . ” 
This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . 
“ Has your son been with you , then ? ” 
She thinks so little of her own beauty . 
I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen-draper . ” 
It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! 
“ My sister and Mr. Bertram . 
Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort . 
Most grievously was she humbled . 
Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . 
Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . 
It was then about twelve o'clock , and she returned to her sister 's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night . 
There were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny . 
The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy . 
One could not leave her out . ” 
'To do the best for himself , ' passed as a duty . '' 
And my poor aunt talking of me every hour ! ” 
`` He likes you . 
Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . 
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . 
I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived . '' 
“ I dare say , ” returned Harriet , sighing again , “ I dare say she was very much attached to him . ” 
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! 
My mind is entirely made up . 
They are parting ; they are shaking hands . 
“ How quick you are ! ” cried Catherine : “ you have guessed it , I declare ! 
This is what we all feel . 
It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . 
You are to have the book , of course . 
How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! 
Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? 
It is not too late . 
Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . 
Isabella , however , caught hold of one hand , Thorpe of the other , and remonstrances poured in from all three . 
Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness ? -- Yours ever , Mary . ” 
And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence , -- the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me . '' 
Jane often says , when she is here , 'I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too ! -- I only wish my eyes may last me as well . 
Mrs. Norris continued , “ It is quite delightful , ma'am , to see young people so properly happy , so well suited , and so much the thing ! 
But , ” she continued , recollecting herself , “ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . 
There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . 
The conviction of his determination once admitted , it was not unwelcome . 
“ Nothing could be more obliging than your manner , I am sure , and I dare say you walked as fast as you could ; but still it is some distance , you know , from this spot to the house , quite into the house ; and when people are waiting , they are bad judges of time , and every half minute seems like five . ” 
Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built. -- And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so. -- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER . '' 
to be sure she did , ” said Mrs. Norris : “ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? 
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . ” 
Confused by his notice , and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance , she turned away her head . 
It is my daily errand . 
`` You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation -- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you ) -- a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . '' 
I always thought it such a sweet place , ma'am ! 
`` If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , '' said Marianne , `` at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . 
and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner . 
“ I would rather be talking to you , ” he replied ; “ but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done . ” 
the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr . 
Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it , and gave themselves no airs ; while the praises attending such behaviour , secured and brought round by their aunt , served to strengthen them in believing they had no faults . 
It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . 
Poor Edward ! 
But “ No , no , no ! ” was the immediate answer ; “ that could not be , for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday. ” Catherine was sorry , but could do no more ; and a short silence ensued , which was broken by Isabella , who in a voice of cold resentment said , “ Very well , then there is an end of the party . 
He keeps a man-servant , does he ? 
“ I wish it may . ” 
I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story . ” 
He had time only to say , 
`` One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . 
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine 's behaviour was most friendly and obliging . 
I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . 
Woodhouse ? -- I am so glad. -- Quite out of my power. -- Such a happy little circle as you find us here. -- Yes , indeed. -- Charming young man ! -- that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr . 
I can not think of it without abhorrence . ” 
shark is only one syllable . 
We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . ” 
“ Well , ” said Miss Crawford , “ and do you not scold us for our imprudence ? 
He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over-powered Marianne . 
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips . 
These apprehensions , perhaps , were not founded entirely on reason , and certainly not at all on truth . 
one never thinks of married men 's being beaux -- they have something else to do . '' 
`` Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable . '' 
`` Kindest regards . 
`` Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , '' said Elinor , `` you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . '' 
She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance . 
`` You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . '' 
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane , and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 
To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person , must be dreadful . 
Lady Catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . 
“ I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . 
“ My father would say 'yes , ' Mr. Knightley 'no ; ' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . 
No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . 
Mr. John Knightley smiled , and replied , 
As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter ! 
Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , 
Catherine 's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words . 
“ I am glad of it , ” said he , in a much brisker tone , and throwing down the newspaper again , “ for I am tired to death . 
He was brilliant , he was headstrong . 
They might chuse to surprize her . ” 
It was as much as Emma could bear , without being impolite . 
I am sorry for it . 
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear the one without involving the other . 
Maria was in a good deal of agitation . 
no , ” said he ; “ it would be the extreme of imprudence . 
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins , and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , though unknown . 
I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you. -- How -- how has it been possible ? ” 
Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith. ” “ Miss Smith ! -- oh ! -- I had not observed. -- You are extremely obliging -- and if I were not an old married man. -- But my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston . 
“ It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , ” said Mr. Crawford , when he was gone . 
Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? 
From what it could arise , and where it would end , were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm . 
However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother 's time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here . 
Sir Thomas is too much my friend . 
If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . '' 
Mr. Rushworth was worked on . 
This was his plan of amends -- of atonement -- for inheriting their father 's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part . 
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . ” 
“ Ah ! -- so you say ; but I can not believe it . ” 
My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . 
Her reflections were in general satisfactory . 
Do not we all ? ” 
Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower-beds , was almost too much for me . ” 
Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . ” 
I am quite of your opinion . 
I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody . 
Catherine took her place at the table , and , after a short silence , Eleanor said , “ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? 
“ But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . ” 
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after -- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy . 
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . 
When Mr. Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite . 
It was soon pain upon pain , confusion upon confusion ; for they were hardly in the High Street before they met her father , whose appearance was not the better from its being Saturday . 
could not have supposed any thing ! -- Such elegance and profusion ! -- I have seen nothing like it since -- Well , where shall we sit ? 
Chuse your own degree of crossness . 
Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world . ” 
He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . 
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr. Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards ; who , when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . 
He will see the Rushworths , which own I am not sorry for -- having a little curiosity , and so I think has he -- though he will not acknowledge it . ” 
His spirits , during the last two or three days , though still very unequal , were greatly improved -- he grew more and more partial to the house and environs -- never spoke of going away without a sigh -- declared his time to be wholly disengaged -- even doubted to what place he should go when he left them -- but still , go he must . 
She only attempted to say , `` How do you do ? 
But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . 
That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter 's continuing in singleness requires explanation . 
“ The finest place in England -- worth going fifty miles at any time to see . ” 
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself . 
`` These are done by my eldest sister , '' said he ; `` and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . 
How unworthily occupied ! 
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley 's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . 
Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . 
The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . 
He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland , and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain , no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent , no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger , could shake his fidelity , or influence the resolutions it prompted . 
Mrs. Bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual . 
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . 
The black mare was blameless ; _they_ were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause . 
No , my dear Fanny , upon no account . 
There must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain . 
Amelia deserves no better . 
They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable . 
What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! 
`` If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . '' 
Can you , in short , be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire ? 
To whose happy lot was it to fall ? 
It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . 
She can not be justified in it . 
“ Only think of its being three months , ” she cried , “ since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . 
“ I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , ” was the result of such thoughts as these ; and upon Sir Thomas 's information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . 
There was a great deal of good sense in all this ; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power ; and Catherine 's feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced . 
Skilful has been the hand ! ” 
She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . 
Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now . ” 
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . 
She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . 
said Elinor . 
“ Dating from three o'clock yesterday . 
She turned into the drawing-room for privacy , but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither , and were at that moment deep in consultation about her . 
The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : 
Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond . 
But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . 
Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance . 
Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . 
Such a change ! 
“ Will you read the letter ? ” cried Harriet . 
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . 
“ Lucky , lucky girl ! ” cried Mary , as soon as she could speak ; “ what a match for her ! 
`` Upon my word , '' said she , `` I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . 
“ Mrs . 
But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . 
And thus ended their discourse . 
Weston ? -- Judge between us . 
I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating. -- I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties . ” 
She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct . 
“ That she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one 's duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one 's eyes and one 's attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for . 
`` And not known to him , perhaps , so soon . '' 
How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen ; and , when Catherine saw what was necessary here , she began to be amazed herself . 
But when she read and re-read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . 
In books too , as well as in music , she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving . 
He was going , and , if not voluntarily going , voluntarily intending to stay away ; for , excepting what might be due to his uncle , his engagements were all self-imposed . 
It was not in Miss Crawford 's power to talk Fanny into any real forgetfulness of what had passed . 
After surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed , you will retire to rest , and get a few hours ' unquiet slumber . 
I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . 
How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual . 
`` No , '' said Anne , `` that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand . '' 
`` But why were you not there , Edward ? -- Why did you not come ? '' 
Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . 
Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? 
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . ” 
Amazed that Isabella could endure it , and jealous for her brother , she rose up , and saying she should join Mrs. Allen , proposed their walking . 
Up jumped Susan , claiming it as her own , and trying to get it away ; but the child ran to her mother 's protection , and Susan could only reproach , which she did very warmly , and evidently hoping to interest Fanny on her side . 
The man replied that none had . 
He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . 
`` How is she , Miss Dashwood ? -- Poor thing ! 
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to choose one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . 
“ I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public . ” 
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents , which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . 
Do not you pity me ? ” 
Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one . 
My father bears it better . 
I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life . ” 
It was the beginning of February ; and Anne , having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme . 
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . 
His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . 
being all that she had time for , as she passed away . 
Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me ! 
The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married . 
`` No , '' replied Elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy 's veracity ; `` I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . '' 
From that period his penance had become severe . 
Portsmouth was Portsmouth ; Mansfield was home . 
Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . 
Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter 's marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield . 
I was the most miserable wretch ! ” 
She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self-government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , “ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift . 
Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . 
Letters of business , too ! 
Mrs. Gardiner 's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : 
He came on the wings of disappointment , and with his head full of acting , for it had been a theatrical party ; and the play in which he had borne a part was within two days of representation , when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers . 
May God support you under your share ! 
The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better . 
No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow . 
How old-fashioned it is ! 
A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis 's understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it . 
“ And really , ” added Edmund , “ the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . 
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . 
It was only to ask Elinor to marry him ; -- and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air . 
The room in question was of a commodious , well-proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing-room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general . 
But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . 
Here Anne spoke -- 
“ You need not distress yourself . 
She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns . 
We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else . 
Are the others coming out ? ” 
It had given him a disgust to his business , and to his residence in a small market town ; and , in quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . 
Yes , novels ; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers , of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances , to the number of which they are themselves adding -- joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works , and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine , who , if she accidentally take up a novel , is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust . 
Dinner was on table. -- Mrs . 
“ Yes , madam , ” said Mrs. Bennet , delighted to speak to Lady Catherine . 
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ” 
Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her. -- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman 's language can make interesting. -- In our communications we deal only in the great. -- However , I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy . ” 
Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks , their equal amazement in beholding it . 
And the next day _did_ bring a surprise to her . 
I have nothing more to shew you , or to say -- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . ” 
CHAPTER 30 
But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself . '' 
“ The ladies were all at home. ” She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule . 
He is desperately in love and means to marry her . ” 
it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! 
“ Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . ” 
If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed ! -- Oh ! 
Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls . 
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably . 
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ” 
“ To be sure ! ” cried she playfully . 
( 1811 ) 
Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father. -- Mr . 
CHAPTER 29 
The gentleman was not so easily satisfied . 
Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . 
He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp , ” was a tender apostrophe of Fanny 's , very much to the purpose of her own feelings if not of the conversation . 
If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account. -- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F -- , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her. -- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . 
Here is a nut , '' said he , catching one down from an upper bough , `` to exemplify : a beautiful glossy nut , which , blessed with original strength , has outlived all the storms of autumn . 
“ You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . 
But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you ; now had not I , Mrs. Allen ? ” 
Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . 
“ Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ” said Mrs. Norris , as they drove through the park . 
“ Heyday , Miss Morland ! ” said he . 
never , never , never ! 
But it is of very little consequence . ” 
Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak , and another pause succeeded . 
I came to rehearse . 
It is no reflection on _you_ ; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced , more or less , in their time . 
“ But we have a charming morning after it , ” she added , desiring to get rid of the subject ; “ and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over . 
Did you ever hear the old song 'Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? ' 
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . ” 
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . 
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ” 
He was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford . 
“ Well -- if you please , ” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating , “ if you think she will be of any use . ” 
As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them , Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . 
You think only of yourself , and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . 
Their spirits were in general exhausted ; and to determine whether the day had afforded most pleasure or pain , might occupy the meditations of almost all . 
“ Handsome ! 
think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend ! 
The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck `` eleven with its silver sounds , '' and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long . 
I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . 
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . 
“ It is about my uncle 's usual time . ” 
He did not come however . 
Jane now came up . 
But Mr. Weston is almost an old man . 
Captain Benwick came not , however . 
I must try to get the better of this . 
In everything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest investigation . 
Julia made no communication , and Fanny took no liberties . 
The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . 
She knew enough to feel secure of an honourable and speedy establishment , and her imagination took a rapid flight over its attendant felicities . 
The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear . 
Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither . 
“ How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? 
the hand and the heart were alike motionless and passive now ! 
I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year . 
He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to-morrow . '' 
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . 
Her mind made up on these several points , and her resolution formed , of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense , she had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever ; and the lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations in the course of another day . 
Another momentary vexation occurred . 
Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself , but that was impossible , and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all . 
The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . ” 
Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere . 
`` A strong mind , with sweetness of manner , '' made the first and the last of the description . 
`` But , upon my soul , I did NOT know it , '' he warmly replied ; `` I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out . '' 
Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . 
It is quite settled . 
It was much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father ; and to think of their father in England again within a certain period , which these letters obliged them to do , was a most unwelcome exercise . 
“ The carriage ! 
Harriet 's features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . ” 
Anne heard nothing of this . 
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never . 
How delightful ! 
We are sadly off in the country ; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury , but it is so far to go -- eight miles is a long way ; Mr. Allen says it is nine , measured nine ; but I am sure it can not be more than eight ; and it is such a fag -- I come back tired to death . 
Others even arose to confirm it . 
replied Lucy ; `` I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . 
That , you know , was so very ... . And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . 
Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . 
dear ! 
But this will not happen to me , I am sure . ” 
You had better not go . ” 
`` Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . '' 
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . 
“ I do not at all know ; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . 
Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . 
After the business of arriving was over , it was first necessary to eat , and the doors were thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the appointed dining-parlour , where a collation was prepared with abundance and elegance . 
Berkeley Street , January . 
The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed . 
Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one , without injuring the rights of the other . 
Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him . 
To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . '' 
she is absolutely charming ! 
“ Does nothing occur to you ? -- Do not you recollect ? -- Harriet Smith . ” 
' ” 
Fanny took the work very quietly , without attempting any defence ; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf -- 
here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it . 
Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . 
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself . ” 
By the bye , I looked in upon them five minutes ago , and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _not_ to embrace , and Mr. Rushworth was with me . 
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . 
I saw her . 
I must order the carriage . 
Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters . 
“ Query , ” said Mr. Crawford , looking round him , “ whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ? 
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 
“ Handsome ! 
Mr. Crawford 's steadiness was honoured , and Fanny was praised , and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world . 
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to be in circulation . 
The misfortune of Harriet 's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . 
“ You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , ” said Mrs. Weston smiling ; “ remember that I am here. -- Mr . 
“ No , ” replied Edmund ; “ I do not think she has ever been to a ball . 
My dearest Henry , the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his , before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions , or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life ! 
What a difference it might have made ! 
The house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east , with an excellent kitchen-garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . 
I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you . 
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . 
I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology , and is not offended . 
After all his objections -- objections so just and so public ! 
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation . 
“ Oh no ! 
My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a few months . 
“ Oh ! 
In this distress , the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation ; their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days , and Captain Tilney 's removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own . 
Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ” 
No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ” 
So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued . 
She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable . 
He must like him less after to-morrow 's visit , for we shall be five hours in his company . 
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . 
Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage , and _she_ was excluded . 
“ Perhaps , ” said Darcy , “ I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction ; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ” 
So much the better . 
I wish I could see her . 
I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . 
Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house . 
It was her manner , however , rather than any unfrequency of meeting . 
Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ? 
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects . 
Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said -- 
The instinct of nature was soon satisfied , and Mrs. Price 's attachment had no other source . 
joining them the moment she is asked . 
There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted . 
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . 
“ Only think ! 
I will have no reserves from _you_ . ” 
`` I am not wishing him too much good , '' said Marianne at last with a sigh , `` when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . 
Has Perry seen her ? 
How few people know what comfort is ! 
Find some body for me . 
An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words . 
Come , mother , you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet . ” 
Of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 
She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose . 
He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . 
It was a fine family-piece . 
“ My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much . 
Clarke . '' 
I was the last man who commanded her . 
I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . '' 
What have you been judging from ? 
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . 
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . 
CHAPTER XVI 
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 
“ I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . 
I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin. ” -- She did not suspect him . 
I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it . '' 
I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . '' 
Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , “ To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ” She could have added , “ A young man , too , like _you_ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable ” -- but she contented herself with , “ and one , too , who had probably been his companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! ” 
I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained . 
But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . 
`` What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! '' 
Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size , and abashed her by noticing her shyness : Miss Lee wondered at her ignorance , and the maid-servants sneered at her clothes ; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow , instructress , and nurse , the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe . 
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 
A few days after this visit , Mr. Bingley called again , and alone . 
I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . 
But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing ; he was not to be of the party to Northanger ; he was to continue at Bath . 
The former she hoped at last might have been accidental , and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity . 
The Colonel , too ! -- perhaps scarcely less an object of pity ! -- Oh ! -- how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance ! 
But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbade the disclosure . 
That must depend upon the binding . ” 
That the general , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine . 
he talks of you , '' cried Charles , `` in such terms -- '' Mary interrupted him . 
“ That is the case with us all , papa . 
I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them . 
I must just speak of it _once_ , I told Sir Thomas I must _once_ , and then I shall have done . 
`` He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , '' repeated Sir John . 
It would be such a delight to have her picture ! ” 
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance . 
He gave her a very plain , intelligible account of the whole ; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding . 
“ Yes , I am fond of history . ” 
Oh , for shame ! -- To be sure you must know better than that . 
“ I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . ” 
`` Indeed , Mrs Smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line . 
When tea was over , Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain . 
“ I want to know , ” said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , “ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . 
_He_ had done it . 
It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome . 
`` I would do more than for my own . 
“ I have heard from authority , which I thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . ” 
Give him a book , and he will read all day long . '' 
so do I . '' 
“ An afterpiece instead of a comedy , ” said Mr. Bertram . 
“ Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , ” said Darcy , “ has too much truth . 
How came it never to be thought of before ? 
it is of no consequence . 
added Mrs Croft . 
He made no reply ; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned ; but as if , on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking , he felt the necessity of instant exertion , he recovered himself again , and after saying , `` Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , '' turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend . 
unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated , demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as conscience must forbid . 
But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . ” 
`` No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . 
In her present exile from good society , and distance from everything that had been wont to interest her , a letter from one belonging to the set where her heart lived , written with affection , and some degree of elegance , was thoroughly acceptable . 
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ” 
“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ” 
Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . 
`` But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ? '' 
A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . ” 
She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . 
A pre-engagement in Edgar 's Buildings prevented his accepting the invitation of one friend , and obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other . 
When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations , it was better for Miss Bertram , who might be said to have two strings to her bow . 
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet , and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game . 
“ But what is to be done about Pemberley ? ” cried Mrs. Gardiner . 
“ Look well ! 
There was no immediate appearance . 
Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . ” 
Without a governess , you must have been neglected . ” 
I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? ” 
Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough . 
I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty . 
But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident , and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent . 
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter . ” 
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister 's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . 
“ Miss Elizabeth Bennet . ” 
“ I am persuaded that he never did . ” 
When the young ladies next met , they had a far more interesting subject to discuss . 
I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night , I would not dance with him , unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel . 
Short , however , was that time . 
But still he would be her husband . 
The distance is nothing when one has a motive ; only three miles . 
Aye , fifty , for what I care . 
Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long . 
But fetch them both . 
In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul . 
Julia Bertram was only twelve , and Maria but a year older . 
But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . 
“ Oh , yes ! 
`` The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , '' said Mrs. Dashwood , `` since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella 's . '' 
All that could be done was , to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession ; one gentleman only was standing there , and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch . 
But let me advise you to think better of it . 
He thanked her , observing , “ How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! 
If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers. ” On Miss Lucas 's persevering , however , she added , “ Very well , if it must be so , it must. ” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy , “ There is a fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with : 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge ' ; and I shall keep mine to swell my song . ” 
A moment 's glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of . 
This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two ; but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result . 
My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing . 
You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! 
“ Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . ” 
The fatigue , too , of so long a journey , became soon no trifling evil . 
I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you. ” But this , with the look of sorrow accompanying it , was enough to melt Catherine 's pride in a moment , and she instantly said , “ Oh , Eleanor , I will write to you indeed . ” 
Just before their setting out from Oxford , while Susan was stationed at a window , in eager observation of the departure of a large family from the inn , the other two were standing by the fire ; and Edmund , particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny 's looks , and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her father 's house , attributing an undue share of the change , attributing _all_ to the recent event , took her hand , and said in a low , but very expressive tone , “ No wonder -- you must feel it -- you must suffer . 
Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . 
“ Proof indeed ! ” said Emma , highly amused. -- “ Mr . 
I do not offer them as new . 
Lady Bertram did : she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity of it , and as to its being considered necessary by his father ; she only pleaded against there being any hurry ; she only wanted him to wait till Sir Thomas 's return , and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself . 
Willoughby. -- Remember that you are married . 
`` Then you would be very ill-bred , '' cried Mr. Palmer . 
Fanny , fatigued and fatigued again , was thankful to accept the first invitation of going to bed ; and before Betsey had finished her cry at being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister , she was off , leaving all below in confusion and noise again ; the boys begging for toasted cheese , her father calling out for his rum and water , and Rebecca never where she ought to be . 
The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them . 
Mr. Crawford would have fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him ; but this , though most material to herself , would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas . 
_He_ had been much in London , and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund , and must , therefore , be preferred ; and , indeed , his being the eldest was another strong claim . 
“ Which do you mean ? ” and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said : “ She is tolerable , but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . 
He is the curate of the parish I dare say . '' 
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well-bred , were not inviting . 
I am not obliged to punish myself for _her_ sins . 
She stopped to breathe . 
`` Oh dear ! '' 
“ And so ended his affection , ” said Elizabeth impatiently . 
Catherine coloured as she warmly answered , “ No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ” 
There was but one obstacle , in short , to be mentioned ; but till that one was removed , it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement . 
She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home . 
But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . 
“ Poor Fanny ! ” cried William , coming for a moment to visit her , and working away his partner 's fan as if for life , “ how soon she is knocked up ! 
If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . 
“ Do you not want to know who has taken it ? ” cried his wife impatiently . 
and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas . 
Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me . ” 
The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits . 
Anxiety on Jane 's behalf was another prevailing concern ; and Mr. Darcy 's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . 
So far each recital confirmed the other ; but when she came to the will , the difference was great . 
Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . 
Mr. Yates 's convenience had had nothing to do with it . 
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! 
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend . 
He may live twenty years longer . 
Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half-past nine ? ” 
If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . 
It is early . '' 
I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . '' 
My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . 
But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . 
`` Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler . 
It will be quite delightful , I declare ! 
And how beautiful we thought he looked ! 
Elizabeth felt Jane 's pleasure . 
'Old fellow ! ' 
And what sort of table do they keep ? 
Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . 
But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions . 
“ And what , ” said Fanny ( believing herself required to speak ) , “ what could you say ? ” 
“ Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . 
You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . 
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley 's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . 
Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer , or have refrained from at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public opposition she foresaw to it , had it not been for the sound of approaching relief , the very sound which she had been long watching for , and long thinking strangely delayed . 
“ Yes . 
CHAPTER XLVII 
“ Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately . ” 
But by G -- , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour ! 
There was little intercourse with the Parsonage . 
“ Errand ! 
Mr. Rushworth is never remiss . 
“ You forget that I have made no answer . 
This is precisely what I wanted . 
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry . 
“ And what do you think I said ? ” -- lowering his voice -- “ well done , general , said I ; I am quite of your mind . ” 
No more is Emma . 
But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . 
Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . '' 
`` I do not see how it can be done , '' said she , `` without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . 
They must encounter each other , and make the best of it . 
She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury to herself : it was a scheme , a trick ; she was slighted , Maria was preferred ; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood ; and before Julia could command herself enough to speak , her brother gave his weight against her too , by saying , “ Oh yes ! 
This was not an agreeable intimation . 
Leave me , and go to him . 
From all that I hear and guess , Baron Wildenheim 's attentions to Julia continue , but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement . 
Anne named them all . 
She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street . 
But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . 
`` Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . 
“ No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . ” 
The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . 
Every thing as natural and simple as possible . 
“ How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father ? ” was her anxious inquiry , as she pointed them out to her companion . 
Company is always cheerful . ” 
They had not a fault to find in him . 
As animated , as diversified , as social , but with circumstances of superiority undescribable . 
Oh ! 
They had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now . 
“ I have very little to say for Frederick 's motives , such as I believe them to have been .
